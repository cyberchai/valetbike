## Parting thoughts regarding new developers...
Regrettably I have not had time to write a rake task to import the station and bike data the ValleyBike devs shared. Glancing at those files, I suspect **there's a bunch of useless columns in the CSV data** so we should dive deeper before trying to use those to seed our database. Our rake task only needs to import some of the information, and we should **follow The Rails Way by using the power of associations between models** rather than uncritically ingesting the raw data.
